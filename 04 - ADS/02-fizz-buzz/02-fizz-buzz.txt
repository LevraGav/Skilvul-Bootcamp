2. STORE "x" AS INTEGER WITH ANY VALUE 

3. IF "x" is LESS THAN 1   
        DISPLAY "The minimum value is 1"  
    
    ELSE   
        STORE "number" AS INTEGER WITH 1   
        WHILE "number" LESS THAN or EQUALS to "x"  
            IF "number" MODULUS BY 3 EQUALS 0   
                DISPLAY "Fizz"  
            ELSE IF "number" MODULUS BY 5 EQUALS 0  
                DISPLAY "Buzz"
            ELSE IF "number" MODULUS BY 3 EQUALS 0 AND "number" MODULUS BY 5 EQUAL 0  
                DISPLAY "FizzBuzz"
            ELSE  
                DISPLAY "number"  
            SET "number" WITH "number" PLUS 1  
        END WHILE
