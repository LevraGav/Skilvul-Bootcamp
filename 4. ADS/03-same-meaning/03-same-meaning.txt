Pseudocode for Palindrome Program:  
1. BEGIN

2. STORE "word" WITH ANY VALUE

3. STORE "length_Word" as INTEGER WITH THE NUMBER of LETTERS from "word" 

4. STORE "count_Right" as INTEGER WITH "lengthWord" MINUS 1  

5. STORE "count_Left" as INTEGER WITH 0 

6. STORE "output" as BOOLEAN 

7. WHILE "count_Right" MORE THAN or EQUALS 0 AND "count_Left" LESS THAN "length_Word" 
        IF "word" INDEX "count_Left" EQUALS "word" INDEX "count_Right" 
            SET "output" WITH TRUE
            SET "count_Left" WITH "count_Left" PLUS 1 
            SET "count_Right" WITH "count_Right" MINUS 1
        ELSE 
            SET "output" WITH FALSE
    END WHILE

8. DISPLAY "output" 

9. END
